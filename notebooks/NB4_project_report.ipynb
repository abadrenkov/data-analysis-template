      "Gold has long been the topic of controversy for investors. Many advise that gold be used as a hedge against inflation while others argue that gold prices are too volatile for this purpose. For our project, we wished to test the functionality of gold as an inflationary hedge.\n",

We hope to calculate the change in gold prices over time from historical data on the price of gold and identify any trends that may result. We will then proceed to calculate the historical fluctuation of gold prices relative to inflation and silver and wheat; that is, we will be looking at the changes of relative prices. We hope to determine the functionality of gold as an inflationary hedge. We will determine this through checking if there if any relationship between gold and inflation. We will further establish credibility through the comparison of price fluctuations of wheat and silver."

This website required a memebership to download the files, so we downloaded them and put them into a google drive. One of the difficulties that we encountered while gathering the data was using the bash command curl to gather something from the google drive instead of from a regular website. The cpi, gold, and silver data was gathered annually and the prices were in pounds.\n",

Wheat data from 1790 to 1950 was obtained from \"Commodity Price Volatility and World Market Integration since 1700\" http://www.sfu.ca/~djacks/data/publications/. The wheat data came in excel files with the prices in shillings per quarter gathered annually, seasonally, or monthly (depending on the file). The difficulty that we had with the wheat data was the the data from \"Commodity Price Volatility and World Market Integration since 1700\" had data about many commodities that we did not need . We had to take subsets of this data in order to "

      "While working on this project, we encountered numberous challenges. The first challenge that we faced was working out of Oski Box. Many packages would not load for us (rJava, xlsx). We had to find other ways to load these packages so they would work on our ipython notebook. We sometimes had to use other packages that had the same functionality in order to get something done. We also encountered numerous errors on Oski box. The most prelevant was that the internet would go out on Oski Box while we still had internet on our computers.\n",

We wanted to gather data over the last 500 years from England. The wheat data was incomplete for a lot of the years. We were forced to combine data from many files together. Even after we did that, we could only have complete data starting from 1550. Luckily, the data for the silver, inflation, and gold was complete and we did not need to go through many files to obtain it.\n",

Given the scatterplot of our data, we did not know enough about time series to come up with very many relevant plots and come up with a good explanation of those plots. We did our best to research the effects of economic policies on the prices of gold. Also, we had trouble showing that something was indeed an inflationary hedge. We had to take subsets of the data in order to do so."
