      "Our group plans to look at the prices of gold over the past 500 years. We hope to calculate the change in gold prices over time from historical data on the price of gold and identify any trends that may result. We will then proceed to calculate the historical fluctuation of gold prices relative to inflation and silver and wheat; that is, we will be looking at the changes of relative prices. We hope to determine the functionality of gold as an inflationary hedge. We will determine this through checking if there if any relationship between gold and inflation. We will further establish credibility through the comparison of price fluctuations of wheat and silver."
